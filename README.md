“Create a client‑side LSTM bike‑demand predictor in TensorFlow.js” You are an expert web developer and data‑scientist tasked with building a browser‑based bike‑demand forecasting demo. The app must run entirely client‑side on GitHub Pages. It should load a CSV file (e.g., SeoulBikeData.csv) containing columns date, hour, rented_bike_count, temperature, humidity, wind_speed, visibility, dew_point_temperature, solar_radiation, rainfall, snowfall, seasons, holiday, and functioning_day. Follow these requirements: File upload and preprocessing: Provide an HTML interface where the user uploads the CSV. Parse the CSV in JavaScript (no backend), convert date to a Date object and ensure hour is numeric. One‑hot encode the categorical columns (seasons, holiday, functioning_day) and encode the hour as sine/cosine features to capture its cyclic nature. Normalise all numeric features (min–max). Create sequences of the previous 24 hours of data for each row (except the first 24) and construct labels as the next 24 hours of rented_bike_count. Split the data chronologically into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20). Model definition (model.js): Use TensorFlow.js to build a sequential LSTM model. The input shape should be (24, num_features). Stack two LSTM layers (64 and 32 units) with dropout. Add a dense layer with 24 units and linear activation. Compile the model with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss. Include functions to train the model and make predictions. Application logic (app.js): Implement a class that ties together data loading, model training, and prediction. Provide buttons to start training and to predict the next day’s demand. Display a progress bar and training metrics (loss/MAE) during training. After prediction, plot the actual versus predicted rental counts for the test period using Chart.js. Also compute and display MAE or MAPE. Ensure tensors are properly disposed to avoid memory leaks. User interface (index.html): Create a simple responsive page with a file input, buttons for training and prediction, a progress bar, and canvas elements for charts. Load TensorFlow.js and Chart.js from CDNs. Import the modules (data-loader.js, model.js, app.js) as ES6 modules. Code organisation: Organise the solution into three JavaScript modules—data-loader.js, lstm-model.js, and app.js—plus the index.html file. Use clear English comments throughout. Do not include any server‑side code; everything must run in the browser. Return only the code blocks for each file labelled exactly data-loader.js, lstm-model.js, app.js, and index.html. Do not include explanatory text outside the code blocks.
